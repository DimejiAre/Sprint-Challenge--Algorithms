#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1)
This is because there isn't any kind of iteration or looping in the function. All operations occur at constant time


b) O(n^2)
This is because there is a nested loop in the function.


c) O(n)
This is because the function utilizes recursion and this happens in linear time.

## Exercise II

1. Declare a variable for floor f
2. Iterate through all floors in the building starting from the bottom
3. At each floor, throw an egg and check if it breaks.
4. If it does not break, move to the next floor.
5. If it breaks assign value of that floor to floor f variable and exit the loop.

Runtime Complexity = Linear time O(n), we iterate through all floors of the building, but only once.
